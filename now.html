<p class="blocktext">State of Ruin</p>
    <p class="blocktext">As of now, many parts of the former site are in utter ruin. The New York Pavilion was one of the most well known examples of this. Plagued with rust and graffiti the site is off limits to the general public, although people do go there to take pictures and trepass often on the abandoned site.</p>
